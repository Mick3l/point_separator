# neural_network_cpp
This project consists of two files: `neural_network.py` and `main.py`.<br/>
`neural_network.py` contains class `neural_network` which implements neural network consisting of input layer, one hidden layer and output layer(size of layers is set in constructor)<br/>
`main.py` contains GUI implementation. You can set blue points by right click and green points by left click. Depending on color and position of a point neural network will change background color<br/>
